/* CLOSURE EXERCISE
The following function implements the roll of a die; it returns a random number between 1 and 6 each time it is called.
const rollDie = function () {
  return Math.floor(1 + Math.random() * 6);
}
console.log(rollDie());  // 1 (for example)
However, instead of a random die, we want to create a cheat die that would let us predict the next number. 
Create a function called makeLoadedDie() which returns a function that when called, 
seems to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, but in fact returns numbers in a row from a hardcoded list.
*/

function makeLoadedDie() {
  const list = [5, 4, 6, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5];
  /* your code here */
  let index = -1;

  return function () {
    /* your code here */
    if(list.length-1 <= index){
      index = 0;
    }else{
      index++;
    }
    
    return list[index];
  };
}

const rollLoadedDie = makeLoadedDie();

console.log(rollLoadedDie()); // 5
console.log(rollLoadedDie()); // 4
console.log(rollLoadedDie()); // 6
